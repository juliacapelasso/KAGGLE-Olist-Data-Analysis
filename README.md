# Olist-Data-Analysis
In this analysis, I analyzed the Brazilian e-commerce Olist during the years 2016-2018 and answered some questions that came up with the data. 
All the data was collect on Kaggle and you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce
I used SQL to do the cleaning, modeling and analysis I also used a little Excel to make a pivot table and used Power BI to do the final visualizations.
